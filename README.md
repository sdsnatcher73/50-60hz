Switch VDP frequency for MSX

These 2 tools allow you to switch the VDP frequency within MSX-DOS. Unlike other versions out there it does not corrupt the screen on an MSX1 computer with a TMS9118 or equivalent VDP. It is also able to switch the VDP frequency on MSX1 computers that do have a V9938 or higher VDP.

The program will work on MSX-DOS versions 1 and 2 as well as all Nextor versions.
